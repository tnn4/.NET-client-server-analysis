Project for analyzing client-server application architecture with Lidgren Networking Library and Monogame

The project is adapted from https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3 and upgraded to run on .NET 6 with a functional client server sample.

If you get an error when building: package restore failed.

Run `dotnet restore` on the command line at the root of the directory.
